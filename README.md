# React Spotify

[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/matiushariman/spotify-app/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/matiushariman/spotify-app)

React Spotify is a web application that mimics the functionality and user interface of the popular music streaming service, Spotify.

The clone is designed to allow users to view their personalized Spotify data, such as their playlists, listening history, and recommended songs. ReactJS is used to create an interactive user interface that updates in real-time as the user interacts with the application.

## Pre-requisites

- Register your application at [Spotify Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/) to get your clientId (`VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID`).
- Upon successful registration, configure your application's callback URL (`VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI`) to `http://locahost:4200/callback/`.

## Setting up your development environment

Run the commands below to setup the app for development purpose

```shell
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/matiushariman/spotify-app.git

# Install dependencies
pnpm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the root folder and add the variables below

```shell
# .local.env

# required - see pre-requisites to learn more about getting your clientId
VITE_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=[YOUR_SPOTIFY_APP_CLIENT_ID]

# required
VITE_SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI=[YOUR_SPOTIFY_APP_REDIRECT_URI]
```

## Running the application(s)

- To run the application, use `pnpm nx serve react-spotify` command.
  - Alternatively (preferred), use nx console plugin in your IDE to run the application.
